Greetings, الله يعطيكم العافية مقدما,


## I implemented the task while trying to implement most of the concepts we talked about yesterday.
## The task was implemented using Typescript, because Javascript doesn't support abstarct classes and interfaces.
## I didn't use LLMs for anything but the main loop (which is a bunch of basic switch cases), everything else was almost implemented solely by myself.
## No actual Database was implemented, but rather a simple csv, but I forgot to store the emails and passwords in it.
## Data validation was carried out using Regular Expressions.
